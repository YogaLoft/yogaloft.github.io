<p>Lee's first experience of yoga came during a dance class in 1997. It would be another ten years before he returned to a regular practice. Working as an academic in various universities across the UK, he spent too much of that decade inside his head, feeling increasingly disconnected from his body. His eventual return to yoga in 2007 allowed him to discover a greater sense of balance. His daily ashtanga practice provides him with the time and space to focus on his breathing and the connection between mind and body.</p>

<p><blockquote>Ashtanga has provided me with the space and the resources to step into a more mindful relationship with my body. I really appreciate the subtle processes, and the potential for gradual changes the practice offers me. Working with my students allows the chance to share this experience and to explore how its process works differently with each individualâ€™s body.</blockquote></p>
<p>He studies regularly with Michael at <a href="http://www.kushyoga.org/">Kush Yoga</a> in Totnes, and he has attended intensive workshops with Richard Freeman, David Swenson and Matthew Sweeney.</p>
