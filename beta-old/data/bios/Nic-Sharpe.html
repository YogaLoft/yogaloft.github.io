<p>INFLUENCES and INSPIRATIONS:</p>
<p>In the late 1980's I began a yoga practice with Leeds Buddhists. Moving to Plymouth this practice developed under guidance from Satyanada and BWY (British Wheel of Yoga) teachers who encouraged me to begin a BWY diploma (94-98). This gave me the opportunity to teach at Plymouth University for 18 years as well as teaching in Adult Education and local Colleges. Iyengar and (later) Viniyoga teachers were also early influences.</p>
<p>Lately I have explored a deeper practice with intensives in Scaravelli as well as with Dr. Bhole (arubhava)</p>
<p>These are my greatest inspirations to date, for which I feel very grateful. I have recently become more involved with DYTF (Devon Yoga Teachers Federation)(borrn 1986) which shares practice Sundays with invited teachers from around the country.</p>
<p>This gives a little clue as to what you may experience in a class, except that it will be a slow, intense exploration with detailed guidelines and suggestions to develop key-awareness and clarity, suitable for all levels.</p>
