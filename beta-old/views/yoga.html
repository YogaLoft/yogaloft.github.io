<div class="col-xs-9"> <h1>About Yoga</h1> <img src="images/yoga/namaste.jpg" alt="Students in a namaste moment" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px"> <p>Yoga stems from ancient Indian traditions and references to yoga practices date back several thousand years.</p> <p>The word Yoga comes from the Sanskrit Yuj which means to join or to yoke: to bring together.The main aim of a yoga practice to bring together the various elements of our being – mind, body and breath.</p> <p>The physical postures help maintain health in the body, bring balance both to the physical and emotional state and allow breathe to flow freely. Breathing techniques help us gain control over and have greater awareness of our emotions. Meditation helps to clear the mind leading to greater focus and clarity.</p> <h2>Yoga Styles</h2> <p>There are many different labels that we have given to certain styles of Yoga that are popular here in the West, but for the most part they all come under the label of Hatha Yoga; this is the name given to the physical practice of yoga and includes breathing techniques, asana (postures) as well as meditation.</p> <p>From there, certain styles or disciplines of yoga have emerged. Some focus on faster moving sequencing of postures and as one becomes familiar with the sequences they become quite like a ‘moving mediation’, other styles focus strongly on alignment and work on deepening a particular posture and developing an understanding their affects. Other styles place a stronger emphasis on breathing techniques and the flow of energy.</p> <p>Finding a style and a teacher that is right for you can have a great effect on your practice. Here at the Yoga Loft we offer different styles of yoga and are more than happy to answer any questions that you may have or that may arise from your practice.</p> </div> <div class="col-xs-3"> <h3>Yoga styles we teach</h3> <p>We offer a complete range of yoga styles: from gentle beginners classes to very dynamic yoga.</p> <ul> <li>Hatha Yoga</li> <li>Beginners</li> <li>Ashtanga Yoga</li> <li>Iyengar Yoga</li> <li>Kundalini</li> <li>Yoga for young people</li> <li>Vinyasa flow</li> </ul> <p>See our <a ng-href="#/timetable">class timetable</a> for more info.</p> </div>
