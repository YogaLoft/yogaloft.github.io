You are encouraged to partake in all six days to truly experience the benefits of a daily practice. (If you absolutely can't make a day, the world will not end or even stop turning but you are encouraged to do your best to attend all six :)</p> Some of the benefits of Mysore: <p><strong>You can show up when it suits you.</strong> As long as you leave enough time to finish your full practice, you can come to Mysore class at any point between the allotted times.</p> <p><strong>You can develop your meditation practice by following your own breath:</strong> Ashtanga is intended to be a moving meditation. Led classes are a fantastic way to learn about the breath and the vinyasa (linked breath and movement), but Mysore-style is where you follow your own breath and deepen your focus and meditation skills.</p> <p><strong>You get individual attention.</strong> In any type of yoga, we come across poses or aspects of the practice that are difficult and challenging. In a led class, you may just skim over a difficult pose, but in Mysore style you have the chance to work one-on-one. Most people feel this individual attention helps their practice soar.</p> <p><strong>You can work at your own level</strong> Instead of wondering why your version of a pose doesn't look exactly like your neighbours you get the chance to explore how a posture feels in your skin. With everyone in the room doing their own practice, Mysore class is a great way to work at your full capacity.</p> </div>
