<p>Sharing the gift of yoga and helping others find calmness and positivity in
  their own lives, is Shilpa's aim.</p>
<p>Shilpa was born in Pune and educated in India with a strong foundation in
  ancient yoga texts, especially the Bhagavad Gita and Surya Namaskar (Sun
  Salutations). She learned the value of sun salutations by watching her
  grandfather practise them until his very last day.<br> The essence of the
  Bhagavad Gita is to connect with our true inner Self. For her, yoga is a way
  of life and she is passionate about sharing this with her students.</p>
<p>She is an experienced Hath yoga teacher from India and her main work has been
  with children's vinyasa yoga classes. She has experience with traditional
  Indian yoga school training where she learned authentic teaching methods and
  Vedic philosophy in a traditional Gurukul environment as well as Iyengar yoga.
  She is great believer of Satyanada yoga.<br>
Both Yoga and meditaion supported her through a challenging pregnancy and yoga
has enhanced her post natal recovery and full return to strength after having
two children. This personal experience has given her first hand insight into
both prenatal and postnatal Yoga.</P>
<p> Shilpa also teaches at schools and after school clubs and is qualified in
  medicine, she has a Master's degree in Exercise and Nutrition from the
  University of Liverpool and is a YMCA fitness instructor. She has also worked
  with cardiac rehab patients for the NHS.</p>
