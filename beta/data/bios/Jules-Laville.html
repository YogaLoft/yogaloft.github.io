<p>Movement has been an essential part of my life since the age of 11. Through
  dancing, I learnt, at an early age, the power of moving and how it enables one
  to communicate, accept and express one’s inner thoughts and emotions. My
  ongoing passion for dance and movement has enabled me to work for the past 20
  years as a performer, choreographer, practitioner, teacher and Dance Director.

<p>My journey with yoga began 6 years ago in 2008 when I was diagnosed with an
  aggressive form of breast cancer.  Throughout my treatment I got on my mat
  daily in order to stay strong both mentally and physically. I felt the need to
  connect with my ‘self’.  I needed to find a way to release high stress levels.
  I needed to neutralise the anxiety and fear that was consuming my body.
  Practicing yoga has been an essential part of my recovery; the experience has
  been life changing. I have developed an inner strength, calmness and
  flexibility ‘on the mat’ and as importantly, ‘off the mat’ in my every day life.

<p>In 2013 I began my Vinyasa Flow Teacher Training with Mercedes Ngoh.  Being
  taught by Mercedes has been one of the most inspirational experiences of my
  life.  I feel very privileged to be able to share with others the joy of
  practicing yoga. And so the next part of my journey begins…</p>
<p>My classes are carefully designed to promote wellness, developing strength
  and flexibility for all levels.  You will experience gentle body opening
  movements connecting to the breath. The class then flows into a series of
  dynamic fluid movement sequences (Surya Namaskars) to create heat and release
  stagnation (energy blocks). Once the heat has been created, at the peak of the
  class, we practice some more challenging poses ;  ‘Headstand’, ‘Wheel’,
  ‘Crow’, for example.  For these ‘peak poses’ there are a series of Kramas ;
  small steps that build towards achieving the peak pose over time, when the
  mind and body are ready. This is a lot of fun. Having fun is also central to
  my practice.  Counter poses and stretches then end the movement section
  (Asana) before we allow the body to absorb the benefits of the practice by
  resting (Savasana).</p>
<p>Music is an important part of my classes. My playlists include a range of
  chilled out sounds as well as more energising world beat music mixes.</p>
