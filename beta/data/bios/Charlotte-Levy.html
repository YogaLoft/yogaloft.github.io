<p>For Charlotte, yoga is a path of spiritual growth and of connecting to our true Selves. It is about opening the heart, being kind and compassionate to ourselves and others, and ultimately healing ourselves on all levels.</p>
<p>Charlotte has been strongly influenced by Max Strom and has attended trainings with him and will continue to do so. She believes in a non-competitive practice and work to build strength, grace and healing through yoga.</p>
