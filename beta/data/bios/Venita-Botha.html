<p>I attended my first yoga class because I felt that my body "needed a good stretch". I settled down on a mat wearing my running shoes and a nervous smile not really knowing what to expect. That first class was the beginning of an amazing journey...</P>
<p>Today, 15 years later, I can honestly say that yoga has changed my life. I love the stillness and inner strength that I have found and the beautiful, kind people I meet through yoga. I love the fact that it is not competitive and that we are all encouraged to progress at our own pace. I love that feeling after the last OM when my world is a kinder, gentler place once again.</p>
   More than anything I love sharing yoga. I completed my teacher training (Hatha yoga) in 2009 at the Durbanville Yoga Centre in the wonderful city of Cape Town, South Africa. I have taught in health centres, yoga studios, one-on-one classes and corporate offices. I am qualified as a childrenâ€™s yoga teacher and Reiki Master.</p>
   In 2014 my family relocated to Plymouth. I am looking forward to teaching yoga and practicing Reiki in this beautiful place.</p>
