<p>I first discovered yoga in 1996 in Montreal whilst working towards a diploma
  in fitness and nutrition and almost immediately noticed that yoga differed from
  other forms of exercise in the way it had a profound effect on the emotional as
  well as the physical state.</p>
<p>Dipping in and out of yoga classes as well as a personal practice for many years,
  in 2009 I finally took the plunge and enrolled in a two year teacher training
  course with the Devon School of Yoga.</p>
<p>I then realised that in Plymouth the only yoga classes on offer were either in
  gyms or in church halls and thought it was time to create a space in Plymouth
  that is solely dedicated to the practice of yoga and so founded the Yoga Loft
  which opened its doors in September 2012. The studio will always hold a special
  place in my heart as my beautiful sister designed the stunning interior before
  losing her fight with cancer two months before we opened.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the studio I have completed a teacher training in Anusara
  Yoga with Bridget Woods Kramer, taken intensives with Glenn Ceresoli (Iyengar),
  studied Budokon (a Martial Arts/Yoga blend) with Cameron Shayne and get to as
  many workshops as I possibly can. I am also currently enrolled in the Devon
  School of Yoga Postgraduate Therapy Course and perhaps most profoundly have had
  the pleasure of attending a retreat and intensive with Clive Sheridan.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to my teachers for all they have passed on to me and believe
  that learning never stops. The more I learn, the more I realise that my knowledge
  only amounts to a tiny drop in the great ocean of 'Yoga'. <br />
  I simply love yoga and the journey it has brought me and in my classes hope to
  share that journey.</p>
