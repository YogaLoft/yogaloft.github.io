                <div><p>Sannyasi Atmamantra (Mark Maunsell-Thomas) has been teaching in the Satyananda Yoga Tradition since 2002, and for the last 7 years has been living in their main ashram in India, Rikhiapeeth.</p>
<p>He offers classes, workshops, and courses in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>asana, pranayama, mudra, bandha, and Yoga Nidra or meditation depending on the level</li>
<li>Meditation for beginners and intermediate students using a variety of practices from the Tantras. </li>
<li>Shatkarma purification half day workshops.</li>
<li>Nada Yoga, chanting, bhajan and kirtan for all levels.</li>
<li>Introduction to Yoga Ecology. The use of yogic practices in developing our relationship with nature.</li>
<li>Havan (vedic fire ceremony) with chanting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Satyananda Yoga is a meditative approach to yoga emphasising the spiritual aspects of yoga and the importance of developing awareness through the use of these classical practices. It offers a systematic way of studying yoga that ensures students develop a firm foundation in their practice from where they can advance safely. It is gentle when compared with the more dynamic styles that have recently become popular, and consequently lends itself much better to the therapeutic application of these practices to the chronic ailments that so many suffer from.</p></div>

                <div><p>I attended my first yoga class because I felt that my body “needed a good stretch”. I settled down on a mat wearing my running shoes and a nervous smile not really knowing what to expect. That first class was the beginning of an amazing journey…</P>
            <p>Today, 15 years later, I can honestly say that yoga has changed my life. I love the stillness and inner strength that I have found and the beautiful, kind people I meet through yoga. I love the fact that it is not competitive and that we are all encouraged to progress at our own pace. I love that feeling after the last OM when my world is a kinder, gentler place once again.</p>
            More than anything I love sharing yoga. I completed my teacher training (Hatha yoga) in 2009 at the Durbanville Yoga Centre in the wonderful city of Cape Town, South Africa. I have taught in health centres, yoga studios, one-on-one classes and corporate offices. I am qualified as a children’s yoga teacher and Reiki Master.</p>
            In 2014 my family relocated to Plymouth. I am looking forward to teaching yoga and practicing Reiki in this beautiful place.</p>

                <div><p>Justin has been Practicing yoga for many years, when he moved to Totnes in 2001 he started practicing with Bill wood, also with Diane long, he found that Scaravelli inspired practice made deep sense to the feeling, breathing body, in a way that was deeply nourishing. He completed a 2 year teacher training with Bill Wood in 2009.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The body loves to move in non-linear ways,softening into deep release and relaxation through the undoing of tension,Learning how to listen to the body, going with it, not against it, avoiding all effort or strain, the body becomes much freer. Rather than imposing postures on the body from the outside, we can soften to receive and open from deep within.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Justin Practices regularly with Bill wood, and also Caroline Lang in Totnes, and also loves to attend workshops with Diane Long and Sophy Hoare.</p></div>

                <div><p>Lee's first experience of yoga came during a dance class in 1997. It would be another ten years before he returned to a regular practice. Working as an academic in various universities across the UK, he spent too much of that decade inside his head, feeling increasingly disconnected from his body. His eventual return to yoga in 2007 allowed him to discover a greater sense of balance. His daily ashtanga practice provides him with the time and space to focus on his breathing and the connection between mind and body.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Ashtanga has provided me with the space and the resources to step into a more mindful relationship with my body. I really appreciate the subtle processes, and the potential for gradual changes the practice offers me. Working with my students allows the chance to share this experience and to explore how its process works differently with each individual’s body.</p>

                <div><p>Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is a technique for living a healthy,happy and spiritually aware life. As a route to self actualisation and emotional and physical health, Kundalini works because it is dynamic, easily accessible and well suited to the fast pace of modern life. We learn how to manage pressure and stress in creative and fun ways. Gaining mastery over our minds and confidence in our focus and our truth.</p>
                    <p>We use a lot of music and mantra which is integral to Kundalini and you get a 10 minute lie down at the end to relax and drift away with blissful healing tunes.</p>

                <div><p>INFLUENCES and INSPIRATIONS:</p><p>In the late 1980's I began a yoga practice with Leeds Buddhists. Moving to Plymouth this practice developed under guidance from Satyanada and BWY (British Wheel of Yoga) teachers who encouraged me to begin a BWY diploma (94-98). This gave me the opportunity to teach at Plymouth University for 18 years as well as teaching in Adult Education and local Colleges. Iyengar and (later) Viniyoga teachers were also early influences.</p><p>Lately I have explored a deeper practice with intensives in Scaravelli as well as with Dr. Bhole (arubhava)</p><p>These are my greatest inspirations to date, for which I feel very grateful. I have recently become more involved with DYTF (Devon Yoga Teachers Federation)(borrn 1986) which shares practice Sundays with invited teachers from around the country.</p><p>This gives a little clue as to what you may experience in a class, except that it will be a slow, intense exploration with detailed guidelines and suggestions to develop key-awareness and clarity, suitable for all levels.</div>

                <div><p>Jo discovered yoga in 1996 in Montreal whilst working towards a diploma in fitness and nutrition. She immediately noticed that yoga differed from other forms of exercise in the way it had a profound effect on the emotional as well as the physical state.</p>
      <p>Dipping in and out of yoga classes as well as a personal practice for many years, in 2009 she took the plunge and enrolled in a two year teacher training course with the Devon School of Yoga.</p>
      <p>Jo then realised that in Plymouth the only yoga classes on offer were either in gyms or in church halls and thought it was time to create a space in Plymouth that is solely dedicated to the practice of yoga and so founded the Yoga Loft which opened its doors in September 2012.</p></div>
