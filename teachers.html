                <div><p>I attended my first yoga class because I felt that my body “needed a good stretch”. I settled down on a mat wearing my running shoes and a nervous smile not really knowing what to expect. That first class was the beginning of an amazing journey…</P>
            <p>Today, 15 years later, I can honestly say that yoga has changed my life. I love the stillness and inner strength that I have found and the beautiful, kind people I meet through yoga. I love the fact that it is not competitive and that we are all encouraged to progress at our own pace. I love that feeling after the last OM when my world is a kinder, gentler place once again.</p>
            More than anything I love sharing yoga. I completed my teacher training (Hatha yoga) in 2009 at the Durbanville Yoga Centre in the wonderful city of Cape Town, South Africa. I have taught in health centres, yoga studios, one-on-one classes and corporate offices. I am qualified as a children’s yoga teacher and Reiki Master.</p>
            In 2014 my family relocated to Plymouth. I am looking forward to teaching yoga and practicing Reiki in this beautiful place.</p>

                <div><p>Lee's first experience of yoga came during a dance class in 1997. It would be another ten years before he returned to a regular practice. Working as an academic in various universities across the UK, he spent too much of that decade inside his head, feeling increasingly disconnected from his body. His eventual return to yoga in 2007 allowed him to discover a greater sense of balance. His daily ashtanga practice provides him with the time and space to focus on his breathing and the connection between mind and body.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Ashtanga has provided me with the space and the resources to step into a more mindful relationship with my body. I really appreciate the subtle processes, and the potential for gradual changes the practice offers me. Working with my students allows the chance to share this experience and to explore how its process works differently with each individual’s body.</p>

                <div><p>INFLUENCES and INSPIRATIONS:</p><p>In the late 1980's I began a yoga practice with Leeds Buddhists. Moving to Plymouth this practice developed under guidance from Satyanada and BWY (British Wheel of Yoga) teachers who encouraged me to begin a BWY diploma (94-98). This gave me the opportunity to teach at Plymouth University for 18 years as well as teaching in Adult Education and local Colleges. Iyengar and (later) Viniyoga teachers were also early influences.</p><p>Lately I have explored a deeper practice with intensives in Scaravelli as well as with Dr. Bhole (arubhava)</p><p>These are my greatest inspirations to date, for which I feel very grateful. I have recently become more involved with DYTF (Devon Yoga Teachers Federation)(borrn 1986) which shares practice Sundays with invited teachers from around the country.</p><p>This gives a little clue as to what you may experience in a class, except that it will be a slow, intense exploration with detailed guidelines and suggestions to develop key-awareness and clarity, suitable for all levels.</div>

                <div><p><p>I first discovered yoga in 1996 in Montreal whilst working towards a diploma in fitness and nutrition and almost immediately noticed that yoga differed from other forms of exercise in the way it had a profound effect on the emotional as well as the physical state.</p>
      <p>Dipping in and out of yoga classes as well as a personal practice for many years, in 2009 I finally took the plunge and enrolled in a two year teacher training course with the Devon School of Yoga.</p>
      <p>I then realised that in Plymouth the only yoga classes on offer were either in gyms or in church halls and thought it was time to create a space in Plymouth that is solely dedicated to the practice of yoga and so founded the Yoga Loft which opened its doors in September 2012. The studio will always hold a special place in my heart as my beautiful sister designed the stunning interior before losing her fight with cancer two months before we opened.</p>
      <p>Since the opening of the studio I have completed a teacher training in Anusara Yoga with Bridget Woods Kramer, taken intensives with Glenn Ceresoli (Iyengar), studied Budokon (a Martial Arts/Yoga blend) with Cameron Shayne and get to as many workshops as I possibly can. I am also currently enrolled in the Devon School of Yoga Postgraduate Therapy Course and perhaps most profoundly have had the pleasure of attending a retreat and intensive with Clive Sheridan.</p>
      <p>I am very grateful to my teachers for all they have passed on to me and believe that learning never stops. The more I learn, the more I realise that my knowledge only amounts to a tiny drop in the great ocean of 'Yoga'. <br>I simply love yoga and the journey it has brought me and in my classes hope to share that journey.</p></div>

Gavin holds the Introductory level 1 and 2 and Intermediate Junior Level 1, 2 and 3 teaching certificates awarded by IYAUK. He continues to train in the U.K. with pupils of BKS Iyengar and in India under the guidance of the Iyengar family.</p>
                <p>BKS Iyengar was born in Bellur, South India in 1918 and started practicing yoga at the age of 16 under the guidance of his Yoga Master, Prof. T. Krishnamacharya. Through his discoveries and innovations, BKS Iyengar quickly established himself as the definitive authority on yoga, and today Iyengar Yoga has become the world’s most practiced method.</p>
                <p>Iyengar Yoga is a dynamic form of exercise that strengthens and invigorates the body. Through alignment, timing and sequencing, it makes the body fit, the mind alert, whilst pacifying the brain.</p></div>

                <div><p>Movement has been an essential part of my life since the age of 11. Through dancing, I learnt, at an early age, the power of moving and how it enables one to communicate, accept and express one’s inner thoughts and emotions.My ongoing passion for dance and movement has enabled me to work for the past 20 years as a performer, choreographer, practitioner, teacher and Dance Director.</p>
                <p>My journey with yoga began 6 years ago in 2008 when I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer.  Throughout my treatment I got on my mat daily in order to stay strong both mentally and physically. I felt the need to connect with my ‘self’.  I needed to find a way to release high stress levels.  I needed to neutralise the anxiety and fear that was consuming my body. Practicing yoga has been an essential part of my recovery; the experience has been life changing. I have developed an inner strength, calmness and flexibility ‘on the mat’ and as importantly, ‘off the mat’ in my every day life.</p>
                <p>In 2013 I began my Vinyasa Flow Teacher Training with Mercedes Ngoh.  Being taught by Mercedes has been one of the most inspirational experiences of my life.  I feel very privileged to be able to share with others the joy of practicing yoga. And so the next part of my journey begins…</p>
                <p>My classes are carefully designed to promote wellness, developing strength and flexibility for all levels.  You will experience gentle body opening movements connecting to the breath. The class then flows into a series of dynamic fluid movement sequences (Surya Namaskars) to create heat and release stagnation (energy blocks). Once the heat has been created, at the peak of the class, we practice some more challenging poses ;  ‘Headstand’, ‘Wheel’, ‘Crow’, for example.  For these ‘peak poses’ there are a series of Kramas ; small steps that build towards achieving the peak pose over time, when the mind and body are ready. This is a lot of fun. Having fun is also central to my practice.  Counter poses and stretches then end the movement section (Asana) before we allow the body to absorb the benefits of the practice by resting (Savasana).</p>
                <p>Music is an important part of my classes. My playlists include a range of chilled out sounds as well as more energising world beat music mixes.</p>

                   <p>Shilpa was born in Pune and educated in India with a strong foundation in ancient yoga texts, especially the Bhagavad Gita and Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations). She learned the value of sun salutations by watching her grandfather practise them until his very last day.<br> The essence of the Bhagavad Gita is to connect with our true inner Self. For her, yoga is a way of life and she is passionate about sharing this with her students.</p>
                    <p>She is an experienced Hath yoga teacher from India and her main work has been with children's vinyasa yoga classes. She has experience with traditional Indian yoga school training where she learned authentic teaching methods and Vedic philosophy in a traditional Gurukul environment as well as Iyengar yoga.

                <div><p>I have been exploring, practicing and teaching many approaches to conscious evolution for over 20 years now and along the way I have become a multi-certified Yoga/Movement Teacher and Body Worker. I am the founder of Prana Motion and a certified teacher of Movement Medicine. Essentially it is my innate passion for life, love and laughter; community, connection and creativity; words, humour and music; yoga, massage and dance that revitalizes my life every day and enlivens the work that I am called to share. I have been incredibly blessed on my journey to have been supported and guided my many wonderful teachers, friends and family and it is a profound, yet simple, honour to share with you as we explore together this curious dance we call being human. We are human beings, human becomings, human dancings.</p>
                <p>I have studied widely in many different approaches to yoga, including Hatha, Vinyasa Flow, Anusara (1000+hours) and Integrative Yoga therapy. I regularly teach in London at TriYoga, The Life Centre and other yoga studios. I have a thorough grounding in anatomy, physiology, biomechanics and yoga therapy.</p>

              <div>
                <p>I have had a keen interest in mind and body unification for nearly 40 years - it has been an integral part of my study of Ki Aikido and Ki Development. In 2014 I discovered that many of  the exercises and methods that I had been practising and teaching were derived from Japanese Yoga.</p>
                <p>These methods were developed by Nakamura Tempu in Japan from the 1920s until his death in 1968 based on his experiences studying Yoga (predominantly Raja Yoga) with a teacher called Kaliappa in the Himalayas.</p>
                <p>ne of his most prominent students was Koichi Tohei. I attended a two week course with him in 1978 and trained in his system for nearly 10 years. This went on to form the basis of my practice ever since.</p>
                <p>I am keen to share what I have learnt, and continue to learn, through these simple but profound methods.</p>
